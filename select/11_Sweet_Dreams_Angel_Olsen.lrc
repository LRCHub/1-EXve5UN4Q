[00:21.18] Every time I close my eyes
[00:25.11] Something small within me dies
[00:29.59] Can't say if it's dark or bright
[00:34.08] But it's all I've ever known
[00:38.25] And when I sleep, I sleep alone
[00:45.44] Alone, alone
[00:51.44] 
[01:02.09] Every time I take a breath
[01:06.05] Something once living inside me has left
[01:10.22] Yes it's alive but it's just passed through
[01:13.10] It's just left me and it's just left you on
[01:21.05] On your own, on your own
[01:33.05] 
[01:56.92] And I love you most
[01:59.02] I love you most
[02:01.14] When I first found love in myself
[02:05.18] And I'll give to you, give it all to you
[02:09.34] When I first find it in myself
[02:13.39] And the time will come for everyone
[02:17.55] For everyone, to know
[02:21.75] Yes the time will come for everyone
[02:26.09] For everyone, to go
[02:35.59] 
[02:33.20] And say goodbye
[02:37.66] And say goodbye
[02:42.14] And say goodbye
[02:48.72] Sweet dreams
[02:53.14] Sleep tight
[02:57.77] Sleep tight
